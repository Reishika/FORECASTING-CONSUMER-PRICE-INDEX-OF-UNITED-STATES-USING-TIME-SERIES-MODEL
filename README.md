# FORECASTING-CONSUMER-PRICE-INDEX-OF-UNITED-STATES-USING-TIME-SERIES-MODEL

•	Project Objective: This project uses U.S. monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from January 2010 to May 2022 to forecast the next 12 values via time series analysis.
•	Trend Analysis: The data reveals a significant trend shift, especially from mid-2020.
•	Model Approach: Two models, ARIMA (1, 2, 2) and Holts’ Linear Trend Model, are employed for different time intervals with good data fitting.
•	Policy Implications: The forecasts aid in government decision-making for efficient policy implementation.
•	COVID-19 Impact: The pandemic has a noticeable influence on CPI, requiring government attention.
•	Control of CPI: Uncontrolled CPI increases are expected if pandemic effects persist, making forecasts less accurate.
